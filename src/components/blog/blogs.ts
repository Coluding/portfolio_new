        summary: "Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) enhances attention mechanisms in machine learning, especially for tasks requiring the processing of long sequences, by addressing hardware limitations. Traditional attention mechanisms, crucial for understanding contextual relationships in data, face challenges with computational and memory demands, particularly in resource-constrained environments. LSH reduces these demands by grouping similar input elements, allowing attention to focus on relevant pairs and thus lowering computational complexity. This optimization facilitates the handling of larger datasets and complex tasks, such as text analysis and genome sequencing, on standard hardware, making advanced machine learning applications more accessible and scalable",

Traditional attention mechanisms, such as the scaled dot-product attention, have been shown to be computationally expensive and memory-intensive, particularly when processing long sequences. Sliding-window attention addresses these limitations by restricting attention to a fixed-size window around the attention token, thereby reducing the computational and memory demands of the attention mechanism. This optimization makes it possible to process longer sequences on standard hardware, making advanced machine learning applications more accessible and scalable.",

        summary: "Mamba is a novel architecture that combines the strengths of Transformers and Selective State Space Models to address the limitations of both models. Transformers have been highly successful in a wide range of applications, particularly in natural language processing, but they suffer from high computational and memory requirements, making them challenging to deploy in resource-constrained environments. State Space Models, on the other hand, are more efficient but lack the expressive power of Transformers. Mamba based on selective state space models aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the strengths of both models to create a more efficient and effective architecture for machine learning tasks." +

        summary: "Policy gradient methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms that directly optimize the policy of an agent to maximize its expected cumulative reward. Unlike value-based methods that estimate the value of different actions or states, policy gradient methods learn a parameterized policy that maps states to actions. This policy is then optimized using gradient ascent on the expected cumulative reward, which is also known as the objective function. Policy gradient methods have been shown to be effective in a wide range of applications, including robotics, game playing, and natural language processing." +

        title: "Basics of Reinforcement Learning: Epsilon Greedy Algorithm, Optimistic Initial Values and Upper Confidence Bound",
        summary: "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training an agent to make decisions within an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment." +
        " The agent is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them out. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics -- trial-and-error search and delayed reward -- are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning. This trial and error paradigm is also known as the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The agent must exploit what it has already experienced in order to obtain reward, but it must also explore in order to make better action selections in the future. The agent must use a balance of exploration and exploitation to maximize its reward over time." +
        "The epsilon-greedy algorithm, optimistic initial values and the upper confidence bound are three  basic strategies to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning.",
        categories: [BlogCategory.ReinforcementLearning, BlogCategory.TheoreticalMachineLearning, BlogCategory.Mathematics],
        content: [String.raw `\section{Introduction} Reinforcement learning (RL) presents a unique challenge and opportunity in the field of machine learning. Agents in an RL environment must learn how to behave by interacting with their environment, aiming to achieve the highest possible cumulative reward. The core dilemma they face is the exploration-exploitation trade-off, where they must decide between exploiting known rewards and exploring new actions that might lead to higher rewards.`,
        String.raw `\section{Epsilon Greedy} The epsilon-greedy algorithm is a straightforward yet effective approach to balance exploration and exploitation. With a probability of $1-\epsilon$, the agent selects the action that has the highest estimated reward based on past experiences (exploitation). With a probability of $\epsilon$, the agent randomly selects any action (exploration). This method ensures that the agent does not become overly focused on the actions that have worked in the past and remains open to exploring new possibilities. `,
String.raw`\section{Optimistic Initial Value} Optimistic initial values is a technique where all actions are initially assigned a high reward estimate. This optimism encourages the agent to explore each action at least once, moving towards less explored actions with potentially higher rewards than what has been experienced so far. Over time, as the agent learns more about the real rewards of actions, these estimates are adjusted to reflect the true values.`,
String.raw`\section{Upper Confidence Bound}The Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm tackles the exploration-exploitation dilemma by choosing the action that has the highest upper confidence bound on the estimated reward. The UCB for each action is calculated based on both the average reward of the action and the uncertainty or variance in its reward estimate. This approach ensures that actions are selected not just based on their average rewards but also considering the confidence level of those estimates, promoting a balance between exploring uncertain actions and exploiting known rewards.
\begin{equation}
    \text{UCB} = \bar{x}_j + \sqrt{\frac{2 \ln n}{n_j}}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{x}_j$ is the average reward of action $j$, $n$ is the total number of times any action has been selected, and $n_j$ is the number of times action $j$ has been selected.    
The exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental aspect of reinforcement learning, dictating the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process. Strategies such as the epsilon-greedy algorithm, optimistic initial values, and the Upper Confidence Bound approach provide structured ways for agents to navigate this dilemma, balancing the need to maximize immediate rewards with the imperative to discover more rewarding actions over time.

It is a Bayesian approach that leverages probability distributions to model the uncertainty in the reward estimates of different actions. The algorithm selects actions based on their probability of being the best action, taking into account both the average reward and the uncertainty in the reward estimates. This approach ensures that the agent explores actions with uncertain rewards while exploiting actions with high expected rewards.
